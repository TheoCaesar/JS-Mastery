                A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie 
                pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
                laminated dough.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into 
                a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

                A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a 
                variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, 
                but not always, have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust referred to as flint. 
            </p>

                A variation made with brown sugar 
                and vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie 
                was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized there during the 
                first half of the 20th century.

            <p>
               Brownies are typically eaten by hand, and may be accompanied by a glass of milk, served warm with 
                ice cream (à la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge.

                Cotton candy, also known as candy floss (candyfloss) and fairy floss, is a spun sugar confection that 
                resembles cotton. It usually contains small amounts of flavoring or food coloring.</p>
            <p>
                It is made by heating and liquefying sugar, and spinning it centrifugally through minute holes,
                causing it to rapidly cool and re-solidify into fine strands.[2] It is often sold at fairs, circuses, 
                carnivals, and festivals, served in a plastic bag, on a stick, or on a paper cone.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is made and sold globally, as candy floss in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, New Zealand, Sri 
                Lanka and South Africa, as fairy floss in Australia, as "daddy's beard" in France, as "girl's hair" 
                in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as "girl’s yarn" in Egypt.
